## The game "Break out" is implemented in OpenGL and C++ from https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/06%20In%20Practice/2D-Game/  07%20Postprocessing/

## The executive program "breakoutOSG.exe" is located in the folder "breakout_opengl/x64"

## compiler: vs2017. 

## attention: I just configured the parameters in x64 debug mode. If you want to build a release version, you can refer to configuration of debug mode.
